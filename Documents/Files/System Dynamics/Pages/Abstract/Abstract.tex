\chapter{Abstract}


The Ball on Beam system is a classic example of control and dynamics problem that describes
the interaction of a ball place on a horizontal beam.
In this Study we will analyze the system into a mathematical model and a simulation.
We are focusing on understanding the interactions between the ball's position ,the beam's angle
and the external forces (e.g gravity).
Through the application of principles from physics and control theory,
we develop a mathematical model that describes the system's behavior.
By employing simulation techniques, we explore how the system responds to different control inputs and external disturbances.
Insights gained from this analysis contribute to a deeper understanding of the fundamental concepts of dynamics, control strategies, and stability in mechanical systems.
This research not only enhances theoretical knowledge but also provides valuable insights for designing and controlling similar systems in various practical applications.
