## Discription
The setup comprises of a ball positioned on a beam (or within a transparent colored tube). Its objective is to maintain balance at a specified distance. Additionally, the system includes an LCD touchscreen which serves as a user interface (GUI). It's important to note that this project is designed for educational purposes, specifically as a demonstration of control theory principles such as comparing PID closed-loop systems to open-loop systems.
